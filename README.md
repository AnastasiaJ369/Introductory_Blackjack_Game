BLACKJACK GAME!

Made with JS, CSS, and HTML, the idea of this personal project was to create a functioning Blackjack card game! 

Single-player against PC, users will be able to bid various amounts ($10, $50, $100, $500, $1,000) with a scoreboard to keep track of their money, initialing beginning with an amount of $2500! Users will also be able to "hit" or "stand", following the basic rules of the game!

If a user runs out of money or if the user just wants to, user will be able to reset the game and start over with the initial $2500!

ENJOY!
