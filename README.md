BLACKJACK GAME! 

Made with JS, CSS, and HTML, the idea of this personal project was to create a basic preface of a Blackjack card game! 

Deck of Cards API https://deckofcardsapi.com was also used in this production!

This project was more complex than I thought it would be and was a great introduction into how extensive creating a program/application can be! Further enhancements will be made to calculate total scores or dealer and player, determine if either bust, push, or won, as well as "bids", "doubling down", "hit", and "stand".
